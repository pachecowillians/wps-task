# task-list-react
 This is a task list made with ReactOS. By now, it is static, but i intend to make it dynamic, using cookies and some API, or database. 
  
  - To add a new task you just need to click on the "Add" button, and fill the fields. 
  - To set a task as finished, just double click on it.
  - To remove the task of the list, just click the "x" button in the top-right place of the task.
